## Value Proposition

**For homebuyers**: Objective, data-driven neighborhood comparison before the biggest purchase of their life.

**For real estate professionals**: Granular area intelligence at the DeSO level (500-3,000 residents) — far more precise than kommun-level statistics.

**For investors**: Predictive scoring that identifies neighborhoods likely to appreciate, backed by trend analysis across multiple public data sources.
